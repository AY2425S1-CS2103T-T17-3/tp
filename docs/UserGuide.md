## QuickStart
### Step 1: Install Java
Before you can use InvenTrack, ensure you have Java version `17` or above installed in your Computer. Java helps you to run our app in your desktop.
- To check if Java is installed:
  1. Open a command terminal using `cmd` in search (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux). <br> Alternate way to open terminal: right-click on the opened folder or desktop, select `Open in terminal` option.
  2. Type the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    java -version
    ```
     If Java is installed, you should see the version number. <br> If Java is not installed, download it from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17?er=221886).

### Step 2: Download InvenTrack
1. Get the latest version of InvenTrack by downloading the `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/releases).
2. Move the .jar file into the folder where you want to store your InvenTrack data (this will be your "home folder").

### Step 3: Navigate to the Folder
To run InvenTrack, you need to open your command terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the .jar file:
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Use the `cd` command to change to the folder containing the `.jar` file. For example:
   - On **Windows:**
     ```
     cd Desktop\InvenTrack
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux:**
     ```
     cd ~/Desktop/InvenTrack
     ```
   Verify that your terminal is now pointing to the correct directory. The terminal prompt should show the folder name `(e.g. InvenTrack)`

### Step 4: Run the Application
To launch the application:
1. In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    java -jar addressbook.jar
    ```
2. After a few seconds, the InvenTrack application should open. A window similar to the one below should appear (note that some sample data may be pre-loaded in the app):

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

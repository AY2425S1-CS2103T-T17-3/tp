## Quick Start
### Step 1: Install Java
Before you can use InvenTrack, ensure you have Java version `17` or above installed in your Computer. Java helps you to run our app in your desktop.
- To check if Java is installed:
  1. Open a command terminal using `cmd` in search (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux). <br> Alternate way to open terminal: right-click on the opened folder or desktop, select `Open in terminal` option.
  2. Type the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    java -version
    ```
     If Java is installed, you should see the version number. <br> If Java is not installed, download it from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17?er=221886).

### Step 2: Download InvenTrack
1. Get the latest version of InvenTrack by downloading the `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/releases).
2. Move the .jar file into the folder where you want to store your InvenTrack data (this will be your "home folder").

### Step 3: Navigate to the Folder
To run InvenTrack, you need to open your command terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the .jar file:
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Use the `cd` command to change to the folder containing the `.jar` file. For example:
   - On **Windows:**
     ```
     cd Desktop\InvenTrack
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux:**
     ```
     cd ~/Desktop/InvenTrack
     ```
   Verify that your terminal is now pointing to the correct directory. The terminal prompt should show the folder name `(e.g. InvenTrack)`

### Step 4: Run the Application
To launch the application:
1. In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    java -jar addressbook.jar
    ```
2. After a few seconds, the InvenTrack application should open. A window similar to the one below should appear (note that some sample data may be pre-loaded in the app):
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

### Step 5: Start Using InvenTrack
You can now start using the application by typing commands into the command box. For example:

   * `add_supplier n/Kayla Beauty p/98136450 e/kaylab@hotmail.com a/Phoenix Cross Road, Hilton Avenue 6` : Adds a supplier named Kayla Beauty with respective phone, email and address.

   * `add_product n/Corn flour stk/50` Adds product named Corn flour with current stock level as 50

   * `view_product` : Helps you to view the current products in the system.

   * `view_supplier` : Lets you see the list of suppliers currently in the system.

   * `delete_supplier n/Kayla Beauty` : Deletes the supplier with the name 'Kayla Beauty'

   * `clear` : Deletes all the information about the suppliers and products in the system completely.

   * `exit` : Helps you to exit the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) below to know more about the commands you could use in this app.

## **Notes about the command format and other information:**

> * **Words in UPPER_CASE**: Words like `PRODUCT_NAME` and `SUPPLIER_NAME` are placeholders for information you need to provide. <br>
 e.g For `add_product n/PRODUCT_NAME`, you would replace these placeholders with actual values, such as `add_product n/Apples`
> * **Items in square brackets are optional.**<br>
 e.g `add_product n/PRODUCT_NAME [stk/STOCK_LEVEL]` can be used as `add_product n/Apples` or as `add_product n/Apples stk/50`.
> * Items with **`‚Ä¶`** ‚Äã after them can be **used multiple times including zero times.**<br>
 e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/beverage`, `t/beverage t/important` etc.
> * Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/SUPPLIER_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/SUPPLIER_EMAIL`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER e/SUPPLIER_EMAIL n/SUPPLIER_NAME` is also acceptable.
> * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123` or `help -10`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
> * If duplicate tags are found for product or supplier, the system takes only one copy of it, others are ignored. But it is case-sensitive, hence `reliable` and `RELIABLE` will be treated as DIFFERENT TAGS.
> * Command words are case-insensitive. eg: `help` and `HELP` are the same.
> * **Copying Commands from PDFs:** If you‚Äôre copying commands from a PDF, be careful that spaces at line breaks may be omitted when pasted, so double-check the spacing.
> * Prefixes Glossary: <br>
> `n/` is for the name of supplier/product <br> `pr/` is for product <br> `su/` is for supplier <br> `p/` is for phone number of supplier <br> `e/` is for email of supplier <br> `a/` is for address of supplier <br> `t/` is for tags added to suppliers/products <br> `stk/` is for stock level of product <br> `min/` is for minimum stock level of product <br> `max/` is for maximum stock level of product <br>

### Adding a supplier: `add_supplier` üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

First let us add your suppliers into the system. 
<br> To do this, use the given command format:

Format: `add_supplier n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã`

> **NOTE:**
> - A supplier can have any number of tags (including 0) <br>
> - Currently, there is no restriction in phone number format, so you can have (+65) 97136544 or even +91-97664 23668, according to any country specific numbers you want to use.
> - No value allows usage of "/", so if you want to use S/O in names, it is better to use alternatives like "son of" as there is no such limit for name length

Here are a few examples to help you:
* `add_supplier n/Fresh Farms Ltd p/98765432 e/contact@freshfarms.com a/23 Orchard Street, Suite 5`

> **IMPORTANT**:
> The product and supplier must already exist in the system before you can assign them.

> **NOTE:**
> MAX_STOCK_LEVEL is the maximum number of products you would like to have in your store for a particular product, so it might happen that CURRENT_STOCK_LEVEL maybe greater than the former because of greater number of purchase order. This helps to suit real world implementation.

---

### Assigning a product to supplier: `assign` üßã ‚û°Ô∏è üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
